# Arduino M0 pro- Symmetric_Block_Cipher_AES Algorithm Implementation

I have implemented AEC algorithm and tested out the encryption and decryption process using two arduino M0 pro (which is basically powered by an  ARM-32 bit cortex M0+ microcontroller), which is an arduino.org board with ARM-32 bit architecture. All thanks to my attached references below , for providing me with base code, which I am able to modify to suit Arduino M0's and also optimise the code for better suited performace for arduino M0 pro's environment. I have tested out the 128, 192 and 256 bit key versions for both ECB and CBC algorithms . 

Also, I have altered the standard AES library offered by arduino.cc and modified it to suit Arduino M0 pro or similar ARM environments, do have a look!
