# Arduino M0 pro- Symmetric_Block_Cipher_AES Algorithm Implementation

I have implemented AEC algorithm and tested out the encryption and decryption process using two arduino M0 pro, which is an arduino.org board with ARM-32 bit architecture. All thanks to my attached reference below , for providing me with base code, which I am able to modify to suit Arduino M0's  environment. I have tested out the 128, 192 and 256 bit key versions for both ECB and CBC algorithms .
